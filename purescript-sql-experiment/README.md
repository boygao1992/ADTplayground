- parallel/vertical composition of non-disjoint lenses is not law abiding
  - type-level functions can enforce lenses to be disjoint during the composition step (distinct paths is isomorphic to distinct nominal types)
    - [fclabels | parallel composition of lenses for record](http://fvisser.nl/post/2013/okt/1/fclabels-2.0.html)
  - for relational database access (which can be roughly interpreted as nested records access using GraphQL encoding of relational algebra), they are disjoint paths in a graph traversal

potential directions
- build on top of a SQL eDSL
  - why eDSL
    - Raw SQL lives in structureless string space and is not composable.
  - pro: no data migration needed for existing data in a RDBMS
  - con: codebase of non-trivial SQL eDSLs (with type-safe join operators, which rules out Persist-Esqueleto) are hard to comprehend e.g. Beam
- build on top of a graph database with RDBMS backend support
  - pro: 
    - easier to build composable eDSL for its query language
      - the concept of paths in graph is already backed in e.g. Gremlin
  - con: 
    - its data encoding in RDBMS may not be human-manageable 
      - e.g. massive indexing for graph traversal and fast modification
    - need a migration step for existing data in other storage
- build on top of GraphQL eDSL
  - GraphQL db layer
    - [PostGraphile](https://www.graphile.org/postgraphile/)
    - [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)
  - graph databases usually have a GraphQL-like query language (subset but with additional filtering operators)
    - [Dgraph](https://dgraph.io/)
    - [Cayley](https://github.com/cayleygraph/cayley)
  - generality v.s. extra layers of indirection
